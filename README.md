### Preview
![vRYjs Table](https://raw.github.com/tanishqmanuja/valo-kit/main/assets/vRYjsTable.png?maxAge=2592000)

### Usage for Noobs (Basic)
1. Download vRYjs.exe from [releases](https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/valo-kit/releases/)
2. Put in a separate folder because software generates temporary helper folder and files.
3. Run and Enjoy!

### Usage for Techies (Intermediate)
1. All steps from `Usage for Noobs`
2. Download file `plugins.yaml` from [here](https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/valo-kit/blob/main/vry-js/plugins.yaml)
3. Place `plugins.yaml` in the same folder as vRYjs.exe
4. Use your creativity to customize the file using the guide below.
```yaml
# Disable a plugin
# Example: sort-by-level: false

plugin-name: false

# Enable a plugin
# Example: team-spacer: true
plugin-name: true

# Enable a plugin with flags
# Example: player-weapons: [Odin]

# if plugin supports single flag
plugin-name: [flag]
# if plugin supports multiple flags
plugin-name: [flag1, flag2, flag3]
```

### Usage for Gods (Advance)
Prerequisites
- node >=18.12

Running from source
1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/valo-kit.git
```

2. Cd to the cloned repo folder

```

3. Enable pnpm if not yet enabled

```

4. Install Dependencies

```shell
pnpm i
```

5. Start vRYjs

```shell
pnpm start:vry-js
```

6. Package vRYjs (optional)

Do this if you want to make your own executable file

```shell
pnpm package

### Notes
1. AntiVirus Programs\
Some antivirus vendors mark .exe file generated using `@vercel/pkg` as trojan. This is a false positive.
Still if you dont trust the executable provided in release, you can build your own or run from the source.
